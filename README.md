# CS 135 Code Snippets.
A repository to keep code snippets throughout CS 135.

One thing to note about this class is that even though the class officially taught in C++, a large portion of the coding style is using C style. I plan on coding snippets from the book and from the class to better understand the class and allow others to better understand it as well.
